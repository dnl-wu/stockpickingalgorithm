The Quantitative Stock Portfolio Advisor is a data-driven application designed to construct a diversified stock portfolio that closely tracks benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 and TSX 60. Using financial metrics such as beta, tracking error and correlation, ranking algorithms, and optimization techniques, the tool selects and weights stocks to achieve maximum alignment with market performance. The output includes the final optimized portfolio worth $1,000,000 CAD, its correlation with the benchmark, and detailed performance metrics about each stock.
